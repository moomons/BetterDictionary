Download and Installation
-------------------------

### OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) and 10.9 (Mavericks)


1. Download the latest version of [EasySIMBL](https://github.com/norio-nomura/EasySIMBL). Currently it is [version 1.7.1](https://github.com/norio-nomura/EasySIMBL/releases/download/EasySIMBL-1.7.1/EasySIMBL-1.7.1.zip).

2. Extract `EasySIMBL-1.6.zip` and move `EasySIMBL.app` into the Applications folder.

3. Download and extract [BetterDictionary-v0.992.zip](https://github.com/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary/releases/download/v0.992/BetterDictionary-v0.992.zip). It contains two files: `BetterDictionary.bundle` and `migrate-data`.

4. Run EasySIMBL.

5. Make sure "Use SIMBL" is checked.

6. Drag and drop `BetterDictionary.bundle` into EasySIMBL:

##### To migrate your data (from Mountain Lion)

1. If you were already using BetterDictionary under Mountain Lion (or older versions) and wish to migrate your data, right-click on `migrate-data` and select 'Open'. In the next dialog, select 'Open' again.

2. Dictionary.app should open now, with all your previous saved words intact. If it didn't work, simply copy `~/Library/Application Support/BetterDictionary/saved-words.plist` to `~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Dictionary/Data/Library/Application Support/BetterDictionary/saved-words.plist`.


### OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion), 10.7 (Lion), and 10.6 (Snow Leopard)

Download [v0.98](https://github.com/downloads/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary/BetterDictionary-0.98.zip) from the [Downloads](https://github.com/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary/downloads) section. Then double-click on `BetterDictionary-0.98.zip` to unzip it.

Right click on `BetterDictionary-0.98.app` and select 'Open'. In the next dialog, select 'Open' again. Then install the SIMBL plugin loader as instructed in the installer.
